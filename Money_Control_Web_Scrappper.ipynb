            "Full Article: Stock Market The Nifty50 hit a \u001b[92mfresh record \u001b[92mhigh on July 13 backed by a rally in technology stocks and \u001b[92mpositive global peers on falling US inflation, but \u001b[91mfailed to sustain above the crucial 19,500 mark for the fifth time in the last six days \u001b[91mdue to selling pressure at \u001b[92mhigher levels. Finally, the index \u001b[91mclosed off the day's \u001b[92mhigh. The index opened \u001b[92mhigher by \u001b[92mmore than 100 points at 19,495 and hit a \u001b[92mfresh intraday all-time \u001b[92mhigh of 19,567, but saw some profit-taking at \u001b[92mhigher levels in the last couple of hours of the session and went closer to the \u001b[91mprevious day's closing levels by hitting a day's low of 19,386. However, the index showed a bit of recovery in \u001b[91mlate trade and settled at 19,414, up 30 points, forming a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. Technically, the index tested the upward-sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of December 1 last year and July 7 this year, but could not sustain there. Hence, unless and until it gives a close above 19,500, the \u001b[92mfresh upward sustainable rally towards 19,600-19,800 levels is \u001b[91munlikely, till then it may remain in the range of 19,300-19,500 levels, experts said. \"Technically, today's candlestick pattern indicates a lack of strength in the market to sustain the \u001b[92mnew highs. We observe rangebound \u001b[92maction in the market around 19,500-19,300 levels in the last week and the sideways movement is \u001b[91mexpected to continue for the short term,\" Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC Securities said. He feels any weakness below the immediate support of 19,300 could \u001b[91mdrag the Nifty \u001b[91mdown to 19,200-19,100 levels in the \u001b[92mnear term. A decisive upside above 19,550 is likely to bring \u001b[92mmore upside for the short term, he said.

The above data indicated that 19,400 can be immediate support for the Nifty50, while 19,600 is \u001b[91mexpected to be immediate resistance. Bank Nifty The Bank Nifty also started off the day on a \u001b[92mstrong note, opening above the 45,000 mark but could not sustain the same optimism in the later part of the session, when the bears started dominating. It means the index was \u001b[91munable to sustain above the 45,000 mark and \u001b[91mclosed with just 26 points gains at 44,665. The index has formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts but negated lower highs and lower lows of the \u001b[91mprevious six consecutive sessions. \"If the bulls want to stage a comeback, the support level (44,500 – 44,400) would \u001b[92mideally be the \u001b[92mpivotal point.

            "Full Article: In June 2022, a KRERA team inspected the site and found several inadequate amenities. The order did not specify which of them were \u001b[91mdeficient. The Karnataka \u001b[92mreal estate regulator has held that a project will be deemed \u001b[92mcomplete only if the \u001b[92mcompetent authority issues a completion certificate. Even if a project was completed before the \u001b[92mReal Estate (Regulation and Development) Act was passed, a completion certificate issued by an architect is not valid proof of completion, the Karnataka \u001b[92mReal Estate Regulatory Authority (KRERA) said on July 6 while passing an order in the matter of the Urbana Serene senior living project in Bengaluru, \u001b[92mdeveloped by the Ozone Group. \"We have consulted our \u001b[92mlegal advisors and we will be \u001b[92mchallenging the order,\" the developer said in a reply to the queries sent by Moneycontrol. Advocates said the judgment sets a precedent in cases where developers deemed a project \u001b[92mcomplete in Bengaluru with certification from architects. The case Related stories Souptik Datta Sub Editor|Moneycontrol Brigade Group to launch 2 million sq ft of office space, double flex space portfolio Increased guidance value will dent affordability in Bengaluru Karnataka RERA holds landowner, developer \u001b[92mresponsible for not executing sale deed Advocate Suryanarayana, who represented the homebuyers, said \u001b[92mmost owners of the Urbana Serene project are above 70 years of age. According to documents submitted to KRERA , the project obtained a completion certificate from an architect in April 2017 and the occupancy certificate was issued by the local town planning authority in batches in April and August that year. In June 2022, a KRERA team inspected the site and found several inadequate amenities. The order did not specify which of them were \u001b[91mdeficient. Additionally, the developer told the regulator that the project was beyond the scope of KRERA registration because the occupation certificate and completion certificate were obtained before RERA was enacted. However, the resident welfare association filed a \u001b[91mcomplaint alleging that the project was \"ongoing.\" Homebuyers' claims Suryanarayana claimed that without forming the RWA to manage and maintain the project , the developer handed over control and management/maintenance of the Serene Urbana project to Columbia Pacific Communities (CPC). \"A corpus fund of about Rs 3.62 crore still remains with CPC. Today, seniors \u001b[92mlive without any fire clearance and faulty lifts. Even the sewage treatment plant is incomplete,\" he added. The homebuyers also claimed that when the occupation certificate was obtained for 360 apartments in six blocks, construction in some blocks was not \u001b[92mcomplete. Additionally, the occupation certificate does not indicate details about the Serene Urbana project, they said. \"Section 2 of the RERA Act makes it \u001b[92mclear that the \u001b[92mcompetent authority to issue the completion certificate is the town planning authority (in this case, the Kannamangala Gram Panchayat) and not the architect,\" the homebuyers claimed before KRERA. \"CPC will extend support and cooperate with the stakeholders. Since we are only service providers to the community and inherited a \u001b[91mpreviously existing service contract, we have sought the intervention of the Karnataka \u001b[92mHigh Court,\" Mohit Nirula, CEO of CPC, told Moneycontrol . However, with regard to faulty STP and fire clearances, it is incorrect, Ozone Group added. KRERA findings KRERA noted that the completion certificate was issued by an independent architect and not the \u001b[92mcompetent authority. It also said sections of Form II and Form V of the completion certificate, as mandated by the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, were incomplete. KRERA referred to a Supreme Court judgment of 2017 and noted that incomplete forms can be termed as fraudulent and also intentional. \"Serene Urbana is not an \u001b[91mordinary apartment \u001b[91mcomplex. It is a retirement home designed with \u001b[92mspecial infrastructure and amenities for senior citizens. Hence, the stated incomplete development makes a \u001b[92mgreater difference for residents,\" KRERA said. Serene Urbana is declared an ongoing project and the respondents are directed to register it under KRERA within two weeks, the regulator ordered. Advocates said several developers had cited the Karnataka \u001b[92mHigh Court ’s decision in Provident Housing vs Karnataka \u001b[92mReal Estate Authority of 2022, which said a project would be considered \u001b[92mcomplete if a \u001b[91mpartial occupation certificate was obtained before RERA came into effect. \"However, in our case, we have \u001b[92mclearly mentioned that the circumstances for the senior living project are different from the project mentioned in the HC order,\" Suryanarayana added. \n",

Byju's, the world's most-valued edtech, has roped in TV Mohandas Pai, one of its initial backers through Aarin Capital and former State Bank of India and current BharatPe Chairman Rajnish Kumar to its newly-constituted board advisory committee to provide advice and guidance to the CEO Byju Raveendran on crucial matters. Raveendran invited Pai and Kumar to join the committee, known as the Advisory Council, and they accepted the role, the company said in a statement on July 13. The two will be mentoring Raveendran and its Board of Directors in the future, the company added. \"Byju and Divya are among the \u001b[92mmost \u001b[92mimpressive entrepreneurs I have worked with from the startup ecosystem.

I see in them the drive to build the group into a \u001b[92msuccessful corporation, and to ensure they deliver upon their mission in this sector as a category creator and market leader,\" said Pai in a statement. \"As part of the Advisory Council, I look forward to advising the leadership in evolving the systems of governance and financial reporting, as well as to grow an organisational structure that can serve as a resilient foundation for the future of the company,\" he added. Last week, Raveendran, in an \u001b[92mextraordinary \u001b[92mgeneral meeting held with over 70 shareholders, had proposed forming a board advisory committee to provide advice and guidance to the CEO on matters pertaining to the composition of the board and the governance structure \u001b[92msuitable for Byju's.

Byju's is also looking to strengthen its management. Earlier in the day, the company roped in Arjun Mohan, former CEO of upGrad, as the CEO of its international business. In a telephonic conversation with Moneycontrol, Kumar said, \"When companies are growing they somehow miss the governance part. We are now realising this in the Indian startup ecosystem.

Bengaluru-based IT \u001b[92mmajor Wipro saw its headcount decline for the third consecutive quarter, ending the June quarter with 7,163 fewer employees than the \u001b[91mprevious quarter. With this, the company’s headcount stands at 2,49,758. In contrast, during the same period last year, Wipro added 15,446 employees. At the same time, the company's attrition numbers have continued their downward trend, with the last-twelve-month rate coming in at 17.3 percent in Q1FY24, \u001b[91mdown from 19.2 percent in the preceding quarter. It’s quarterly annualised attrition is at an 8-quarter-low of 14 percent. In the last fiscal, Wipro’s headcount addition in each subsequent quarter fell precipitously — where it added over 15,000 employees in the \u001b[92mfirst quarter, 605 in the second, and saw a decline of 435 and 1823 respectively in the third and fourth quarters. The company \u001b[91mpreviously cited the number of people it added in FY22 and the \u001b[92mfirst quarter of FY23 as one of the reasons for not adding headcount. However, hiring is an indicator of demand. As demand has fallen, hiring numbers were not \u001b[91mexpected to be \u001b[92msignificant across companies.

It is crucial, as Wipro has a \u001b[92mlarge bench. Net utilisation excluding trainees this quarter stands at 83.7 percent. The \u001b[91mwide bench is also the reason why Wipro has not gone to campuses in FY23 to recruit freshers.

            "Full Article: In the last 10 years, the world \u001b[92meconomic prospects have declined whereas the Indian economy has managed to grow albeit at a slower pace and has been relatively resilient amidst the recent global shocks. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently released a report of an Inter-Departmental Group chaired by Radha Shyam Ratho on the internationalisation of the Indian rupee (INR). The internationalisation of the rupee has been discussed ever since RBI took some steps towards the internationalisation of the rupee in July 2022 . The \u001b[92mnew IDG report gives us \u001b[92mmore ideas on the need to internationalise the INR and the process to achieve it. \u001b[92mFirst, what is an international currency? Any currency performs three functions of money: medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. At an international level, the functions are the same but it is applied at two levels: private and official. In the private sector, the international currency , like any national currency, should be used privately for paying for transactions, storing value and seeing the same currency unit for different goods and services. One does not wish to travel to a \u001b[91mforeign country and get stuck on any of these functions. In the official sector, the international currency is used for strategic purposes. Governments and central banks keep international currencies as reserve assets to intervene in forex markets. While a national currency needs to tick the three functions, an international currency needs to tick all six functions. While a government can still make a case for making a currency national, it cannot do so for making a currency international. International currencies take decades to develop and last \u001b[92mnearly a century or \u001b[92mmore as we can see from the case of the British pound and the US dollar. Related stories Bengal Panchayat Polls: TMC’s big \u001b[92mwin no indication of its 2024 prospects Meet the $4 billion AI superstars that Google lost How to tell where the global economy is headed Second, why should a country care to position its currency as an international currency? \u001b[92mClearly, both the private and the official sectors gain as thy do not have to deal with exchange rate risks. The US exporters and importers are never worried about keeping the US dollar for international transactions. The US government is obviously never worried as it can just print and pay in USD. There is \u001b[91mlittle need to keep \u001b[91mforeign exchange reserves and so on. The borrowers also face lower costs in the case of borrowing from abroad. All the \u001b[91mother countries have to sweat for earning dollars via exports, which are then used to pay for imports from \u001b[91mother countries. If a country cannot export, it has to borrow US dollars to pay for imports. If the borrowed dollars are not paid back, the country faces a crisis as seen in the case of Sri Lanka and Pakistan. It is not that there are only gains from internationalisation. There are costs as well but \u001b[92mmuch of it is again borne by \u001b[91mother countries. The prevalence of the USD as an international currency means the Federal Reserve policies do not just impact the US but also \u001b[91mother countries. The words of the Federal Reserve officials are tracked all around the world for cues on interest rates and the USD. Once An International Currency Third, what leads to the INR positioning itself as an international currency? \u001b[92mFirst of all, being an international currency is not \u001b[92mnew for the rupee. It was used \u001b[91mwidely across the Persian Gulf states . Once these states introduced their \u001b[92mown currency in the 1960s and 1970s, the INR was withdrawn. In the current context, the situation is \u001b[92mmore \u001b[91mcomplex. The world economy has been in turmoil. The US has held sway over world politics, economics and currency for almost a century now. The rise of China and the Russia-Ukraine war have tilted the power structures \u001b[92mconsiderably. There is a thinking that we need to move away from US hegemony to a \u001b[92mmore multipolar world where multiple currencies can work as international currencies. One \u001b[92mmajor precondition for internationalising a currency is that the economy should be international as well. India has made \u001b[92mgreat progress since the opening of the economy in 1991. As per the IDG report, in the period 2012-22, exports have grown 1.4 times to $421.9 billion and imports have grown by 1.25 times to $612 billion. In the same period, India’s \u001b[91mforeign exchange reserves \u001b[92mnearly doubled to $560.4 billion and \u001b[91mforeign \u001b[92mdirect investment has increased by 1.8 times to $84.8 billion. In the last 10 years, the world \u001b[92meconomic prospects have declined whereas the Indian economy has managed to grow albeit at a slower pace and has been relatively resilient amidst the recent global shocks. These multiple factors have made a case for internationalising the INR as well. Accordingly, the IDG has laid a roadmap without any timelines for internationalising the INR. It has divided the recommendations into short-term and medium-term measures. The short-term measures are around encouraging private usage of the INR in trade and finance transactions. On the official front, INR usage has to be encouraged by setting up local currency settlement frameworks and even multiple currency settlement frameworks such as Asian Currency Union. India’s financial and payment markets need to be integrated with global markets. There is a long-standing matter of including Indian bonds in global indices. The medium-term measures are around harmonising taxes so that Indian and global investors can raise funds in and outside India. Indian banks should be allowed to use the INR in their off-shore branches. \u001b[91mSlow And \u001b[92mSteady Process The IDG has also studied how different currencies — the USD, Euro (which has tried \u001b[92mvery \u001b[91mhard to compete with the US Dollar), Australian dollar and finally Chinese renminbi — have in \u001b[92mmany ways shaken the global monetary system. There is a timeline on the Chinese renminbi’s journey towards internationalising which started in 2002 and is still an ongoing journey. It validates the point that it takes decades to build an international currency. One \u001b[92minteresting point made by the IDG is that capital account convertibility is not a prerequisite for internationalising the rupee. This means that India can continue to open its capital account gradually and also work towards internationalising the INR. This lesson seems to be coming from how China has gone around internationalising the renminbi without the need to fully open the capital account. But then economists would suggest that capital account restrictions are acting as an impediment towards making the renminbi a \u001b[92mmore international currency than it is currently. Overall, the IDG report has led to ideas and thinking on not just the internationalisation of the INR but even the economy, as both are intertwined. Even if the IDG has suggested short-term and medium-term measures, \u001b[92mmost of them are going to play out over a \u001b[92mmuch longer term. Amol Agrawal teaches at Ahmedabad University.

India's domestic air traffic in June \u001b[92mrose 18.8 percent compared to the same month last year. Domestic airlines carried 1.24 crore passengers in June, data released by the Directorate \u001b[92mGeneral of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on July 13 shows. However, domestic air traffic in June fell 5.5 percent compared to May when airlines carried 1.32 crore passengers. Air traffic has seen a \u001b[92mconsiderable jump from pre-Covid levels. In June 2019, domestic airlines carried only 1.20 crore passengers. June marks the fourth \u001b[92mstraight month when domestic air traffic in India has surpassed pre-COVID levels in India. The aviation pie The market share of India's largest airline, IndiGo, \u001b[92mrose 180 basis points in June, recording the second \u001b[92mstraight month of rise in market share after the collapse of GoFirst, which stopped all operations on May 2.

The low-cost carrier flew 78.93 lakh passengers in June. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Air India retained its position as the second-largest domestic carrier in June and garnered a market share of 9.7 percent, flying 12.13 lakh passengers during the period. The Tata-Group airline saw its market share rise for two consecutive months in a row in May and June \u001b[92mmainly \u001b[91mdue to the grounding of Go \u001b[92mFirst. Air India witnessed its market share fall from 9.2 percent in January to 8.6 percent in April, falling 20-30 basis points every month. Vistara's market share in June fell by 90 basis points to 8.1 percent, the airline flew 10.11 lakh passengers last month. AirAsia India, which, is also part of the Tata stable, \u001b[92mrose to the fourth spot in terms of market share. Its market share \u001b[92mrose by 10 basis points to 8 percent in June, as the carrier served 10.04 lakh passengers. The \u001b[92mnew entrant Akasa Air overtook SpiceJet in terms of market share in June as it carried 6.18 lakh passengers in June garnering a market share of 4.9 percent. Akasa Air saw its market share rise by 10 basis points in June. SpiceJet saw its market share fall another 100 basis points in June, as it continues to struggle with its operating capacity \u001b[91mdue to financial constraints. On July 11, DGCA put SpiceJet under \"enhanced surveillance\" amid the budget airline facing multiple financial headwinds in recent months. In the last \u001b[91mfew months various lessors of SpiceJet have sought repossession of aircraft and some of the cases have been settled by the airline. SpiceJet had seen its market share fall 40 basis points in May, 60 basis points in April, 70 basis points in March, 20 basis points in February, and 30 basis points in January. The airline's market share has fallen consecutively for the last 13 months in a row, data from the DGCA showed. SpiceJet had a peak market share of 10.7 percent in February 2022. \u001b[92mMost of GoFirst's market share of 6.4 percent carrying 8.29 lakh passengers in April has gone the way of IndiGo for the last two month, as the latter has seen its market share rise 570 basis points in the last two months. The passenger load factor, or the occupancy rate, of SpiceJet, Vistara, IndiGo, Air India and AirAsia India stood at 93.6 percent, 93.1 percent, 90.9 percent, 88.2 percent, and 91.8 percent, respectively, in June. Akasa Air, India's newest carrier, saw its passenger load factor remain \u001b[92mconsistent at 91.1 percent in June, its 11th month of operations. As \u001b[92mmany as 344 passenger complaints were received in June, data shows. The number of complaints per 10,000 passengers carried was around 0.28. In June, Vistara had the \u001b[92mbest on-time performance, leapfrogging Akasa Air who had maintained the pole position for three \u001b[92mstraight months in a row till May. Vistara recorded an on-time performance of 88.3 percent at four metro airports — Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mumbai. IndiGo and Akasa Air were the second and third followed by Air Asia. On-time performance of Indian carriers recorded a 4-5 percent drop in June compared to May as \u001b[91mheavy rainfall across India \u001b[91mforced the airlines to delay flights. \n",

            "Full Article: A car \u001b[91muntraceable \u001b[91mdue to floods could end up as a total loss claim The \u001b[91mterrifying visuals of cars being washed away and houses collapsing \u001b[91mdue to floods in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, along with waterlogged streets in Delhi and Gurugram, have once again brought to fore the havoc that torrential rains can wreak on lives and properties. \u001b[92mGeneral insurance companies are bracing themselves for claims from the region . “We have received around 50-55 claim intimations from car owners so \u001b[92mfar. Torrential rains hit these states over the weekend. So, our sense is that \u001b[92mmany people wouldn’t have ventured out. From that perspective, claim impact could be \u001b[91mlimited, but it’s too \u001b[92mearly to tell. Perhaps, the picture will be clearer in another two to three days’ time,” says TA Ramalingam, Chief Technical Officer, Bajaj Allianz \u001b[92mGeneral Insurance . Also read: Bengaluru floods: \u001b[92mGeneral insurers brace for \u001b[92mmore claims as incessant rains cause damage to vehicles He, however, does not expect too \u001b[92mmany home insurance claims. “Home insurance penetration in India is minuscule – \u001b[91mless than one percent. So, claims may not be \u001b[92msignificant on that front either,” he says. Car swept away in floods? File for total loss claim Related stories ITR filing: Switching between \u001b[92mold, \u001b[92mnew tax regimes possible, with some hassles ITR filing: How to file income from capital gains or set off capital losses Forgot to bring your ATM card? Here’s how you can withdraw cash without a debit card If your car got swept away by floods and cannot be recovered – or is recovered with \u001b[92msignificant damage -- chances are that insurers will treat this as a case of total loss. \u001b[91mTypically, if the cost of getting your vehicle repaired exceeds 75 percent of its insured declared value (IDV is your car’s ex-showroom price \u001b[91mminus depreciation in line with its age), an amount equal to the IDV is paid out. “If it is \u001b[91mless than this limit, there will be a sanction for repairs and the cost will be reimbursed,” adds Ramalingam. However, in situations where there is massive damage, insurers could use \u001b[92mcertain \u001b[91mother parameters to ascertain whether it can be treated as a case of total loss or not. “Insurance companies and OEMs \u001b[92m(original equipment manufacturers) come to an agreement on the quantification of loss, depending on the level of water submergence– whether it is up to the floor level or dashboard level. If it is dashboard level and above, it is considered a total loss. In the case of high-end vehicles, electronic parts are located at lower levels and the quantum is decided accordingly. This also varies from model to model. So, the entire IDV \u001b[91mminus the excess (or compulsory deductible) is paid out to the policyholder,” says Nitin Deo, Chief Technical Officer, Zuno \u001b[92mGeneral Insurance. The compulsory deductible is the amount that the policyholder has to bear out of her \u001b[92mown pocket, depending on the car’s engine capacity – Rs 2,000 if it exceeds 1500cc and Rs 1,000 if it doesn’t – before the insurer settles the claim. Also read: MC explains: Why third-party motor insurance is critical for all vehicles on the road To file a claim, an FIR and police investigation will be necessary. “If the insured car has been swept away and cannot be located, there will not be any evidence to speak of. A simple FIR may not always be enough. Insurance companies could insist on a non-traceable certificate from the police, which is issued after an investigation of the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the vehicle in the floods,” explains Hari Radhakrishnan, Regional Director, \u001b[92mFirst Policy Insurance Brokers. Zero depreciation, engine protect covers to the rescue Besides causing damage to the car, rains and water inundation can also lay your car's spare parts to \u001b[91mwaste. In such cases, the claim will be paid out after subtracting the applicable depreciation mentioned in the policy. For instance, on plastic parts, the rate of depreciation will be 50 percent, while it will be 30 percent for fiberglass parts and nil for glass. For all \u001b[91mother parts, the rate of depreciation is linked to the age of the vehicle. It is five percent for vehicles that are six months to one year \u001b[92mold and can go up to 50 percent in case of vehicles that are over 10 years \u001b[92mold. \u001b[92m“Most policyholders purchase a zero-depreciation add-on. This ensures that the actual value of the parts will be paid out,” says Deo. “Some policyholders also buy the consumables add-on to cover the cost of oil, and nuts and bolts, for example. So, if you have purchased these add-ons, the entire loss you have incurred on the car \u001b[91mminus the deductible will be paid out.\" An engine protect cover comes in \u001b[92mhandy if you have to drive through waterlogged roads. \u001b[92m“Many policyholders tend to think that if their engine is damaged \u001b[91mdue to water ingress, the claim will be paid. However, this is not the case, unless you have purchased an engine protect add-on,” says Animesh Das, Chief Underwriting Officer, Acko \u001b[92mGeneral Insurance. \u001b[91mGrey area around \u001b[92minnovative pay-as-you-use add-ons Since July 2022, several \u001b[92mgeneral insurance companies have been offering \u001b[92minnovative, optional riders such as pay-as-you-drive and motor floater add-on covers. For instance, if you were to buy the pay-as-you-use rider, you can save on premiums if your car usage is \u001b[91mlimited. You can activate or deactivate the insurance cover \u001b[91mtypically through the company’s app, depending on your usage. What if you had switched off the coverage when floods swept away your car? “Every insurer has different terms and conditions for add-ons such as pay-as-you-use or pay-as-you-drive. However, \u001b[91mtypically, the switch-on, switch-off feature will come into play in case the policyholder was driving a car. If it was parked in the garage and it got flooded, then switch-on, switch off will not apply. Moreover, since the damage is caused by external factors such as floods, the add-on terms and conditions will not come into play and the claim will be paid,” says Das. Deo, too, reiterates that such claims will be paid. This, though, remains a \u001b[91mgrey area with differing views. Finally, it will boil \u001b[91mdown to your policy’s terms and conditions. “The pay-as-you-use rider allows the policyholder to activate or deactivate coverage for specific periods. If the pay-as-you-use rider was deactivated at the time of the incident, it means that the coverage for that period may not be applicable,” says Pankaj Vashishtha, Founder and CEO, PolicyEnsure, an insurance broking \u001b[91mfirm. He, however, recommends making enquiries with the insurer concerned as individual policy clauses could vary. “The claim will likely be rejected. This is because the pay-as-you-use rider benefit is designed to provide coverage only when the benefit is turned on. If the benefit is turned off, the car will not be covered by insurance,” says Ashish Lath, Business Head, InsuranceDekho, an insurance broking \u001b[91mfirm. However, he points out that there could be some exceptions to this rule.“For example, if the individual can prove that she turned the pay-as-you-use rider benefit off accidentally, the claim may be approved. Additionally, some insurance companies may have a grace period, during which the claim could still be approved even if the pay-as-you-use rider benefit was turned off,” he adds. \n",

Outlook for July 14 Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research, Religare Broking Markets traded volatile on the weekly expiry day but managed to end marginally \u001b[92mhigher. Initially, upbeat global cues triggered a gap-up start in Nifty, which was later followed by range bound move. However, a \u001b[91msharp decline in the second \u001b[91mhalf trimmed the gains and it finally settled at 19413.75 levels. Meanwhile, a mixed trend was witnessed on the sectoral front wherein IT and realty posted \u001b[92mstrong gains while energy and auto were among the \u001b[92mtop \u001b[91mlosers. Niftyâ€™s \u001b[91mfailed attempt to break out from the 19300-19550 zone indicates further consolidation ahead. However, the prevailing buoyancy in the global markets, especially the US, would help in keeping the tone \u001b[92mpositive. Meanwhile, we recommend maintaining a cautious approach in the selection of stocks and focusing \u001b[92mmore on risk management. Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas The Nifty witnessed a volatile day of trade today. During the \u001b[92mfirst \u001b[91mhalf, it opened the gap up and also broke out of the seven days on the upside, however, as the day progressed it faced selling pressure at \u001b[92mhigher levels and sold off. It has come back in the range indicating a breakout \u001b[91mfailure. The Nifty is likely to consolidate in the range of 19300 â€“ 19570 and until this range is decisively breached on either side we can expect the sideways price \u001b[92maction to continue. Overall, the trend is \u001b[92mpositive, and Nifty is undergoing time-wise correction. The crucial support zone stands at 19360 â€“ 19320 while the resistance zone is placed at 19550 â€“ 19570. As \u001b[92mfar as Bank Nifty is concerned, the Index continued to correct and traded in a downward-sloping channel. It has now reached the lower end of that channel and also the 50% Fibonacci retracement level (44600) which should attract buying interest. We expect the Bank Nifty to start recovering as it has now reached a crucial support zone. On the upside initially, we expect it to target 45000.

The Nabard chief did not specifically mention the month when the bonds would be issued or the tenure for these securities. \u001b[91mGreen bonds are debt instruments used by corporates and banks to raise funds from the capital market. The funds raised through these bonds will be utilised for renewable and \u001b[91mgreen projects. “We need to audit ourselves so that we are \u001b[92mcapable of showing to the investors that whatever the \u001b[91mgreen bonds are raising is properly used.
